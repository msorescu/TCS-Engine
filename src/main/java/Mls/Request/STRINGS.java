    /// <summary> We don't referense strings directly, because optimizer links them constantly and staticly
    /// to the class which uses them. So when we replace STRINGS with another class conrtaining
    /// different strings (for example using another language), we don't achive our goal.
    /// Strings remain the same unless we recompile all the classes that use them.
    /// <p>To avoid static linkage we access strings indirectly  - through this function, which
    /// simply gets them from strings array by index.
    /// <p>Some parts of iTP use the inheritance from java.util.ListResourceBundle to achive the same
    /// goal (for example net.toppro.tponline.itp.ServiceReports.Common.STRINGS). We think it takes
    /// too much resources for such a simple problem. It actually puts all the strings to Hashtable
    /// using string keys. So the number of strings doubles.
    /// <p>Another disadvantage of resource bundles is late linkage. If we misspell resource name, compiler
    /// can't help us to find an error, and it goes to runtime. This solution uses early linkage. The parameter
    /// is variable name and compiler can check it, preventing misspellinig errors at the compile time.
